# mechintlab
Reverse-engineer LLM internals: features → circuits → algorithms  Reproduce “induction heads”, “toy superposition”, and sparse feature extraction (SAEs)  Build infrastructure to run &amp; visualize experiments at toy scale → medium models  Provide clean writeups and null results with ablations
